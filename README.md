# Palindrome-Checker
Palindrome Magic is a delightful web application designed to entertain and educate kids by turning the concept of palindromes into a magical adventure. Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same backward as forward, and this project aims to make learning about them fun and engaging for young minds.
